### âš¡ Proyects

```js
module.exports = {
    app: {
        name: 'Dj Elotero',
        use: 'Discord Bot Music',
        global: true
    },
    app-2: {
        name: 'Sr Elotero Bot',
        use: 'Discord Multipurpose',
        global: false
    },
};
```

Dj Elotero ðŸŒ½

- `app/name`, The name of the bot was inspired by a friend of mine that I esteem too much
- `app/use`, Currently it is not very well known, it is active in a few servers but, I hope one day to see it verified ðŸ¤µ
- `app/global`, It is public to anyone who wants to add it to their server, but the base code is not
- `app/invite`, If you want to try it or leave it on your server as a preferred music bot, I would greatly appreciate your interest in trying it [Invitation link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=987401156756119652&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

Sr Elotero Bot ðŸŒ½

- `app-2/name`, Like dj elotero he is inspired by a very dear friend 
- `app-2/use`, This bot is multipurpose so it can be your main bot but currently
- `app-2/global`, Unfortunately, it is a private bot so it was made exclusively for a specific server, I regret not being able to add the bot
